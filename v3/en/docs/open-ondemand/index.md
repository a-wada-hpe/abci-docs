1. **Files**: Perform file operations in the browser.

2. **Jobs(implementation in progress)**: Edit and manage jobs in the browser.

3. **Clusters**: Open the console for the interactive nodes.

4. **Interactive Apps**: Launch web applications on the compute nodes and transfer the screen to the web browser.

<!-- 5. **AI Hub**: AI Hub is a collection of tools and services for reusing large-scale pre-trained models on the ABCI. It provides an application to manage the deployment of the MLflow Tracking Server, one of the features that constitute AI Hub.-->
