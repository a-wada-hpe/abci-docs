# ABCI Cloud Storage

ABCI Cloud Storage Service offers an object storage service that has a compatible interface with Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3). We call the service as Cloud Storage hereafter.

Cloud Storage has unique capabilities.

- Amazon S3 interface compatibility

    Users store data into a globally unique bucket through the interface compatible with Amazon S3. Clients compatible with S3 such as AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) and s3cmd are available. Users can also make client tools by using boto though some APIs are not supported. The example of usage of AWS CLI is shown in another section.

- Encryption

    Data transfers between clients and the storage are encrypted.

!!! note
    Users can access the storage only from the computate nodes or interactive nodes.
    Currently users cannot access from outside(internet). We will announce if it is prepared.

When using Cloud Storage, the user must agree to and comply with the [ABCI Cloud Storage Terms of Use](https://abci.ai/ja/how_to_use/data/cloudstorage-agreement.pdf) (Japanese version only).

To start using Cloud Storage, User Administrator of each ABCI group should apply for use on [ABCI User Portal](https://portal.v3.abci.ai/user/).
If you are not a User Administrator, please contact to User Administrators of your group.
For details of the operation, refer to [ABCI Portal Guide](https://docs.abci.ai/v3/portal/en/).

ABCI points based on the total size of Cloud Storage usage applied at ABCI User Portal by the User Administrator of the group is substracted from the balance of the group's points, then the users of the group can store objects up to the amount. The User Administrator of the group must apply to increase or decrease the amount. There is no charge for data transfer or API calls. Users can check the total size by [show_cs_usage](getting-started.md#checking-cloud-storage-usage).

To use Cloud Storage, please apply for usage in 1TB increments via [ABCI User Portal](https://portal.v3.abci.ai/LoginPage?ec=302&startURL=%2Fs%2F). Refer to [price list](https://abci.ai/en/how_to_use/tariffs.html) for ABCI point consumption per 1TB. However, for minor usage such as system operation verification or functional testing, usage within 1MB is possible without consuming ABCI points.

| [Access Control (1)](abci-cloudstorage/acl.md) | This section shows how to control accessibility by ACL. Data can be shared between groups. |
| [Access Control (2)](abci-cloudstorage/policy.md) | This section explains access control which is applicable to buckets and user accounts. It is possible to set access control that cannot be done with ACL. Access control settings for buckets can be done with a 'Cloud Storage Account for user', but 'Cloud Storage Account for manager' is necessary to set for access control settings for accounts. |
