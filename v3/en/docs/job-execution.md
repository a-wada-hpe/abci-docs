# Job Execution

## Job Services

The following job services are available in the ABCI System.

| Service name | Description | Service charge coefficient | Job style |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| On-demand | Job service of interactive execution | 1.0 | Interactive |
| Spot | Job service of batch execution | 1.0 | Batch |
| Reserved | Job service of reservation | 1.5 | Batch/Interactive |

For the job execution resources available for each job service and the restrictions, see [Job Execution Resources](#job-execution-resource). Also, for accounting, see [Accounting](#accounting).

### On-demand Service

On-demand service is an interactive job execution service suitable for compiling and debugging programs, interactive applications, and running visualization software.

See [Interactive Jobs](#interactive-jobs) for usage, and [Job Execution Options](#job-execution-options) for details on interactive job execution options.

### Spot Service

Spot Service is a batch job execution service suitable for executing applications that do not require interactive processing. It is possible to execute jobs that take longer or have a higher degree of parallelism than On-demand service.

See [Batch Jobs](#batch-jobs) for usage, and [Job Execution Options](#job-execution-options) for details on batch job execution options.

### Reserved Service

Reserved service is a service that allows you to reserve and use computational resources on a daily basis in advance. It allows planned job execution without being affected by the congestions of On-demand and Spot service. In addition, since you can reserve more days than the elapsed time limit of the Spot Service, it is possible to execute jobs for a longer time.

In Reserved service, you first make a reservation in advance to obtain a reservation ID (Resv ID), and then use this reservation ID to execute interactive jobs and batch jobs.

See [Advance Reservation](#advance-reservation) for the reservation method. The usage and execution options for batch job is the same as for Spot service.
The usage and execution options for interactive jobs and batch jobs are the same as for On-demand and Spot services.

## Job Execution Resource

The ABCI System allocates system resources to jobs using resource type that means logical partition of compute nodes.
When using any of the On-demand, Spot, and Reserved services, you need to specify the resource type and its quantity that you want to use, submit or execute jobs, and reserves compute nodes.

The following describes the available resource types first, followed by the restrictions on the amount of resources available at the same time, elapsed time and node-time product, job submissions and executions, and so on.

### Available Resource Types

The ABCI system provides the following resource types:

| Resource type name | Description | Assigned physical CPU core | Number of assigned GPU | Memory (GB) | Local storage (GB) |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| rt\_HF | node-exclusive | 96 | 8 | 1920 | 14 |
| rt\_HG | node-sharing<br>with GPU | 8 | 1 | 160 | 1.4 |
| rt\_HC | node-sharing<br>CPU only | 16 | 0 | 320 | 1.4 |

Please refer to the [accounting information](https://abci.ai/en/how_to_use/tariffs.html) for the charges associated with each resource type.

### Number of nodes available at the same time

The available resource type and number of nodes for each service are as follows. When you execute a job using multiple nodes, you need to specify resource type `rt_HF`.

| Service | Resource type name | Number of nodes |
|:--|:--|--:|
| On-demand  | rt\_HF       | 1-128 |
|   | rt\_HG       | 1 |
|   | rt\_HC       | 1 |
| Spot  | rt\_HF       | 1-128 |
|   | rt\_HG       | 1 |
|   | rt\_HC       | 1 |
| Reserved  | rt\_HF       | 1-(number of reserved nodes) |

### Elapsed time and node-time product limits

There is an elapsed time limit (executable time limit) for jobs depending on the job service and resource type. The upper limit and default values are shown below.

| Service | Resource type name | Limit of elapsed time (upper limit/default) |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Spot      | rt\_HF, rt\_HG, rt\_HC | 168:00:00/1:00:00 |
| On-demand | rt\_HF, rt\_HG, rt\_HC | 12:00:00/1:00:00 |

In addition, when executing a job that uses multiple nodes in On-demand or Spot services, there are the following restrictions on the node-time product (execution time &times; number of used nodes).

| Service | max value of node-hour |
|:--|--:|
| Spot:                         | 21504 nodes &middot; hourss |
| On-demand                                     |    12 nodes &middot; hours |

!!!note
    There is no limit on the elapsed time in the Reserved service, but the job will be forcibly terminated when the reservation ends. See [Advance Reservation](#advance-reservation) for more information about restrictions on Reserved Services.

### Limitation on the number of job submissions and executions

The job limit of submission and execution for the job service are as follows. 
The number of the submitted jobs to the reserved node is included in the number of unfinished/running jobs as well as other On-demand/Spot job and are affected by the limit.

| Limitations                                                       | Limits  |
| :--                                                               | :--     |
| The maximum number of tasks within an array job                   | 75000   |
| The maximum number of any user's unfinished jobs at the same time | 1000    |
| The maximum number of any user's running jobs at the same time    | 200     |

Until fiscal 2023, there was no limit on the number of jobs executed per resource type, and the system was allocated sequentially from the available calculation resources. Starting in fiscal 2024, we will impose restrictions on the number of running jobs at the same time per system for each resource type.
The Job Services subject to this will be the On-demand Service and the Spot Service.
Jobs submitted to reserved nodes in the Reserved service are not included in the count.

| Resource type name | Maximum number of running jobs at the same time per system |
|:--|:--|
| rt_HF | 736 |
| rt_HG | 240 |
| rt_HC | 60 |

## Job Execution Options

Use `qsub` command to run interactive jobs and batch jobs.

The major options of the `qsub` command are follows.

| Option | Description |
|:--|:--|
| -P *group* | Specify ABCI user group. You can only specify the ABCI group to which your ABCI account belongs. (mandatory) |
| -q *resource_type* | Specify resource type (mandatory) |

| -e *stderr_name* | Specify standard error stream of job. The output file will be created after the job completes. |
| -k oe | During execution, the standard output and standard error output are streamed to *JOB_NAME*.o*NUM_JOB_ID*. However, if this option is used, the standard output and standard error output will not be directed to the files specified by -o or -e. |
| -j oe | Specify standard error stream is merged into standard output stream |
| -m n | Specify not to send emails |
| -m a | Mail is sent when job is aborted |
| -m b | Mail is sent when job is started |
| -m e | Mail is sent when job is finished |
| -J *start*-*stop*[*:step*] | Specify the index range of the array job with *start*-*stop*[*:step*]. *start* is the first index and *stop* is the upper index bound. *step* is the stepping factor; if not specified, it is assumed to be 1. |
| -M *mail_address* | Specify the recipient email address with *mail_address*. The default is the email address registered with ABCI for the job execution user |

In addition, the following options are available as extended options.

| Option | Description |
|:--|:--|
| -v RTYPE=resource\_type | Specify the resource type to be used for the reserved job. This option is mandatory when submitting a job to a reserved node. |
| -v USE\_SSH=*{0,1,2}* | Specify SSH login to the compute nodes assigned to the job execution. The default is the  SSH login function disabled. 0: All group members including yourself cannot access, 1: Only your account can access, 2: Group members including yourself can access |

## Interactive Jobs

To run an interactive job, add the `-I` option to the `qsub` command.

```
$ qsub -I -P group -q resource_type -l select=num [options]
```

Example) Executing an interactive job (On-demand service)

```
[username@login1 ~]$ qsub -I -P grpname -q rt_HF -l select=1
[username@hnode001 ~]$ 
```

!!! note
    If ABCI point is insufficient when executing an interactive job with On-demand service, the execution is failed.

To run applications that use the X Window System, log in to the interactive node using software that supports X servers, such as MobaXterm. Then, when executing an interactive job, specify the `-X` option in the arguments:

```
[username@login1 ~]$ qsub -IX -P grpname -q rt_HF -l select=1 -l walltime=01:00:00
[username@hnode001 ~]$ xterm <- execute X application
```


## Batch Jobs

To run a batch job on the ABCI System, you need to make a job script in addition to execution program.
The job script is described job execute option, such as resource type, elapsed time limit, etc., and executing command sequence.

```bash
#!/bin/sh
#PBS -q rt_HF
#PBS -l select=1
#PBS -l walltime=1:23:45
#PBS -P grpname

cd ${PBS_O_WORKDIR}

[Initialization of Environment Modules]
[Setting of Environment Modules]
[Executing program]
```

Example) Sample job script executing program with CUDA

```bash
#!/bin/sh
#PBS -q rt_HF
#PBS -l select=1
#PBS -l walltime=1:23:45
#PBS -P grpname

cd ${PBS_O_WORKDIR}

source /etc/profile.d/modules.sh
module load cuda/12.6/12.6.1
./a.out
```

Additionally, to output the standard output of each command in the job script to a file during job execution, you can use the redirect `>&`.

Example) To output the standard output to a file during job execution

```bash
#!/bin/sh
#PBS -q rt_HF
#PBS -l select=1
#PBS -l walltime=1:23:45
#PBS -P grpname

cd ${PBS_O_WORKDIR}

./a.out >& logfilename
```


### Submit a batch job

To submit a batch job, use the `qsub` command. The job ID is displayed after submission. 

```
$ qsub job_script
```

Example) Submission job script run.sh as a batch job (Spot service)

```
[username@login1 ~]$ qsub run.sh
1234.pbs1
```

!!! note
    If ABCI point is insufficient when executing a batch job with Spot service, the execution is failed.

### Job submission error

If the batch job submission is successful, the exit status of the `qsub` command will be `0`.
If it fails, it will be a non-zero value and an error message will appear.

### Show the status of batch jobs

To show the current status of batch jobs submitted by the user, use the `qstat` command.

```
$ qstat [option]
```

The major options of the `qstat` command are follows.

```


### Stdout and Stderr of Batch Jobs

Standard output file and standard error output file are written to job execution directory, or to files specified at job submission.
Standard output generated during a job execution is written to a standard output file and error messages generated during the
job execution to a standard error output file if no standard output and standard err output files are specified at job submission,
the following files are generated for output.
Additionally, the output file will be created after the job completes.

- *JOB_NAME*.o*NUM_JOB_ID*  ---  Standard output file
- *JOB_NAME*.e*NUM_JOB_ID*  ---  Standard error output file


## Environment Variables

During job execution, the following environment variables are available for the executing job script/binary.

| Variable Name | Description |
|:--|:--|
| PBS\_ENVIRONMENT         | For batch jobs, 'PBS\_BATCH' is set, and for interactive jobs, 'PBS\_INTERACTIVE' is set. |
| PBS\_JOBID             | Job ID |
| PBS\_JOBNAME           | Name of the PBS job. |
| PBS\_NODEFILE  | The absolute path includes only hosts assigned by PBS |
| PBS\_LOCALDIR | The local storage path assigned by PBS |
| PBS\_O\_WORKDIR     | The working directory path of the job submitter |
| PBS\_ARRAY\_INDEX       | Index number of the array job task the job represents |

!!! warning
    Do not change these environment variables in a job because they are reserved by the job scheduler and may affect the job scheduler's behavior.

## Advance Reservation

In the case of Reserved service, job execution can be scheduled by reserving compute node in advance.

The maximum number of nodes and the node-time product that can be reserved for this service is "Maximum reserved nodes per reservation" and "Maximum reserved node time per reservation" in the following table. In addition, in this service, the user can only execute jobs with the maximum number of reserved nodes. Note that there is an upper limit on "Maximum number of nodes can be reserved at once per system" for the entire system, so you may only be able to make reservations that fall below "Maximum reserved nodes per reservation" or you may not be able to make reservations. [Each resource types](#available-resource-types) are available for reserved compute nodes.

| Item | Setting Value |
|:--|:--|
| Minimum reservation days | 1 day |
| Maximum reservation days | 60 days |
| Maximum number of nodes can be reserved at once per ABCI group | 192 nodes |
| Maximum number of nodes can be reserved at once per system | 384 nodes |
| Minimum reserved nodes per reservation | 1 nodes |
| Maximum reserved nodes per reservation | 192 nodes |
| Maximum reserved node time per reservation | 64,512 nodes x hour |

### Make a reservation

To make a reservation compute node, use `qrsub` command.
When the reservation is completed, a reservation ID will be issued. Please specify this reservation ID when using the reserved node.

!!! warning
    Making reservation of compute node is permitted to a Responsible Person or User Administrators.

```
$ qrsub options
```

| Option | Description |
|:--|:--|
| -R *YYMMDD* | Specify start reservation date (format: YYMMDD) |
| -D *days* | Specify reservation day. |
| -P *group* | Specify ABCI UserGroup |
| -N *name* | Specify reservation name. Up to 230 characters can be specified, consisting of alphanumeric characters and the symbols `+-_.`, excluding spaces. |
| -n *numnodes* | Specify the number of nodes. |

Example) Make a reservation 4 compute nodes (H) from 2025/01/15 to 1 week (7 days)

```
[username@login1 ~]$ qrsub -R 250115 -D 7 -P grpname -n 4 -N "Reserve_for_AI"
R1234.pbs1 UNCONFIRMED
```


The ABCI points are consumed when complete reservation.
In addition, the issued reservation ID can be used for the ABCI accounts belonging to the ABCI group specified at the time of reservation.

!!! note
    If the number of nodes that can be reserved is less than the number of nodes specified by the `qrsub` command, the reservation acquisition fails with error messages.

### Show the status of reservations

To show the current status of reservations, use the `qrstat` command.

```
$ qrstat [option]
```

The major options of the `qrstat` command are follows.

| Option | Description |
|:--|:--|
| -f, -F | Display detailed information about reservations |

Example)

```
[username@login1 ~]$ qrstat
Resv ID         Queue         User     State             Start / Duration / End
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
R1234.pbs1      R1234         usrname  RN            Wed 10:40 / 1506000 / Sat Feb 01 21:00
```

| Field | Description |
|:-|:-|
| Resv ID | Reservation ID (Resv ID) |
| Queue| Queue name |
| User | Executing user |
| State | Status of reservation(CO: Reservation confirmed, RN: Reservation running) |
| Start | Start reservation date (start time is 10:00 a.m. at all time) |
| Duration | Reservation term (seconds) |
| End | End reservation date (end time is 9:30 a.m. at all time) |

To check the number of reservable nodes per group, specify the group name with the `--available=grpname` option of the `qrstat` command and execute it. This option is available to all users.

Example) Check the number of reservable nodes per group
```
[username@login1 ~]$ qrstat --available=grpname
date       available nodes for group
---------- -------------------------
01/30/2025                       192
01/31/2025                       192
```


### Cancel a reservation

!!! warning
    Canceling reservation is permitted to a Responsible Person or User Administrators.

To cancel a reservation, use the `qrdel` command. If you specify a reservation ID that does not exist or a reservation ID that you do not have deletion permission for, an error occurs and any reservations are not canceled.

Example) Cancel a reservation

```
[username@login1 ~]$ qrdel R1234.pbs1
```

### How to use reserved node  

To run a job to a reserved compute node, use the `-q` option of the `qsub` command to specify the reservation queue. The reservation queue can be identified by the string before the dot (`.`) in the reservation ID, or by checking the `Queue` column in the output of the `qrstat` command.

Additionally, specify the resource type to be used on the reserved node with the -v `RTYPE=resource_type` option in the qsub command.

Example) Execute an interactive job of `rt_HG` on compute node reserved with reservation ID `R1234.pbs1`.

```
[username@login1 ~]$ qsub -I -P grpname -q R1234 -v RTYPE=rt_HG -l select=1
[username@hnode001 ~]$ 
```

Example) Submit a batch job of `rt_HG` on compute node reserved with reservation ID `R1234.pbs1`.

```
[username@login1 ~]$ qsub -P grpname -q R1234 -v RTYPE=rt_HG -l select=1 run.sh
9290.pbs1
```

!!! note
    - You must specify ABCI group that you specified when making reservation.
    - The batch job can be submitted immediately after making reservation, until reservation start time.
    - The batch job submitted before resevation start time can be deleted with `qdel` command.
    - If a reservation is deleted before reservation start time, batch jobs submitted to the reservation will be deleted.
    - At reservation end time, running jobs are killed.

### Cautions for Using reserved node

Advance Reservation does not guarantee the health of the compute node for the duration. Some reserved compute nodes may become unavailable while they are in use. Please check the following points.

* To check the availability status of the reserved compute nodes, using the `qrstat -f Resv ID` command. 
* If some reserved compute nodes appear unavailable status the day before the reservation start date, consider canceling the reservation and making the reservation again. 
* For example, if the compute node becomes unavailable during the reservation period, please check [Contact](./contact.md) and contact <abci3-qa@abci.ai>.

!!! note
    - Reservation can be canceled by 9:00 p.m. of the day before the reservation starts.  
    - Reservation cannot make when there is no free compute node.  
    - Hardware failures are handled properly. Please refrain from inquiring about unavailability before the day before the reservation starts.  
    - Requests to change the number of reserved compute nodes or to extend the reservation period can not be accepted.

Example) Check the nodes reserved with reservation ID `R1234.pbs1`.
```
[username@login1 ~]$ qrsub -R 250115 -D 7 -P grpname -n 3 -N "Reserve_for_AI"
R1234.pbs1 UNCONFIRMED
[username@login1 ~]$ qrstat -f R1234.pbs1
(skip)
resv_nodes = (hnode015[0]:ncpus=96+hnode015[1]:ncpus=96)+(hnode021[0]:ncpus=96+hnode021[1]:ncpus=96)+(hnode022[0]:ncpus=96+hnode022[1]:ncpus=96)
Authorized_Users = username@login2
Authorized_Groups = groupname
```

## Accounting

### On-demand and Spot services

In On-demand and Spot services, when starting a job, the ABCI point scheduled
for job is calculated by limited value of elapsed time, and subtract processing is executed.
When a job finishes, the ABCI point is calculated again by actual elapsed time, and repayment process is executed.

Please refer to the [accounting information](https://abci.ai/en/how_to_use/tariffs.html) for the charges related to On-demand and Spot services.

!!! note
    * The five and under decimal places is rounding off.
    * If the elapsed time of job execution is less than the minimum elapsed time(1.8 seconds), ABCI point calculated based on the minimum elapsed time.

### Reserved Service

In Reserved service, when completing a reservation, the ABCI point is calculated by
a period of reservation, end subtract processing is executed.
The repayment process is not executed unless reservation is cancelled.
The points are counted as the usage points of the person responsible for the use of the group.

Please refer to the [accounting information](https://abci.ai/en/how_to_use/tariffs.html) for the charges.

!!! note
    Reservation for Compute Node (H) is treated as resource type rt_HF.
